## Description

This application is a full-stack MERN applicaiton that accesses the Google Book Search API that allows a user to sign up, and save books including the books, image, title, authors, and description. The user is also capable of removing books from their Saved Books List.

This application was refactored from its existing RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Servier via GraphQL queries and mutations. This application also depends on MongoDB, Express, React and Node.
